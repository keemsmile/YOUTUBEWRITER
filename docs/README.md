# Swarm Integration Documentation

This directory contains documentation and lessons learned from our attempts to integrate OpenAI's Swarm framework into our YouTube content generation system.

## Directory Structure

1. `01_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
   - Captures what went wrong in our first integration attempt
   - Documents critical mistakes and technical issues
   - Provides code examples of incorrect implementations

2. `02_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Detailed plan for our second integration attempt
   - Phase-by-phase breakdown of tasks
   - Testing and validation requirements
   - Emergency procedures

## How to Use These Docs

1. **Before Starting**
   - Read `01_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` thoroughly
   - Understand what went wrong and why
   - Note the specific technical issues to avoid

2. **During Implementation**
   - Follow `02_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` step by step
   - Check off tasks as they're completed
   - Reference lessons learned when making similar changes

3. **If Problems Arise**
   - Check if the issue is documented in lessons learned
   - Follow emergency procedures in the integration plan
   - Document any new issues encountered

## Important Notes

- These docs are kept outside the git repository to preserve knowledge across branches
- Update these docs with new lessons as we proceed
- Use as a reference when making architectural decisions
